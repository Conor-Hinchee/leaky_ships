## ⛵ Why We Love Ships

Ships and sailboats represent **freedom**, **adventure**, and the **human spirit**! From the graceful lines of a racing yacht to the sturdy hull of a cargo vessel, each ship tells a story of craftsmanship and purpose.

**But leaky ships?** Ugh, they're the absolute worst! There's nothing more frustrating than a beautiful vessel that can't stay afloat

## ⚠️ Important Notice

This application is intentionally designed to develop memory leaks and performance issues. I am building this project to as an example of how my Heap Analysis tool can help identify and fix memory leaks in JavaScript applications. You can find that project [here](https://github.com/moarwaffles/heap-analysis-tool).

- a Next.js web application celebrating our absolute love for sailboats and ships of all kinds!

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
